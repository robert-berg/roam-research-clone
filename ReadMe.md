# Roam Research Clone made with Svelte

<p>This project implements most of the key feautures of the popular knowledge management application <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. </p>

<p>This tool is useful for organizing academic literature because it makes it easy to draw connections between different works. Itâ€™s basically an alternative method for visualizing a literature review, except it makes it much easier to specifically justify the connections between different works.</p>
